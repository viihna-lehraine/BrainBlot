							<p>This is the beginning of some placeholder content. My grandmother once ate an entire 1987 Pontiac Firebird in front of the entire family while we filmed it. She was very sick afterwards, but we were so shocked that none of us thought to stop her. We had seen her eat go-karts in the year leading up this event, but it was NOTHING like this...</p>
							<p>Soon after she left the hospital, the signs began to show...</p>
							<p>Her voice lowered and became unintelligible. Her eyes shined like flashlights in the darkess. She made the most god-awful sounds as she walked. Just like the grinding of metal on metal. It was too late. There was no turning back. She was turning into a werecar.</p>
							<p>Of course the symptoms faded, but we all knew it was a matter of time. The full moon wa approaching and we had no idea how to container the madness that was coming. We stood watch outside her house on that fateful summer evening. Suddenly, as the clouds passed and the moon came into view, the most terrible sound I've ever heard boomed forth from her house, shattering her doors and windows. From those windows a bright light shone forth, like nothing we had ever seen. It lit up the night with the wild beauty of a Bat Signal. And then came the sound of a 5.2L V8 engine roaring.</p>
							<p>She drove through the walls and then ran us all over. Everyone died.</p>
