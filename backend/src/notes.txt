1. get gpg passphrase working in app.ts startup

2. create AdminSecretsStore class

3. ensure AdminSecrets are ALWAYS MASKED AND WILL NEVER PRINT NO MATTER WHAT THE FUCK ANYONE DOES

4. write a listening function that will check if they STILL somehow got printed and then throw every goddamn alert I can come up with

5. fix secrets masking in logger configs

6. ensure secrets, env vars, and logger instances initialize in the correct order

7. ensure environment configs, error files, and logger files have no circular dependencies

8. create 2 new GPG keys just for use with this server so if they are compromised, your entire life isnt fucked
