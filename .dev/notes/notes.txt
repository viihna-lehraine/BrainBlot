/src/server.js (helmet)
    * make sure I have a source for styles and fonts to load from

* hidePoweredBy is not being followed as intended

* more icon types
    * 32x32
    * apple-touch-icon

* let users decide whether to have search engines index their guestbook page or not

* recovery methods!

* finish adding logging

* add cron job to backup /backend/src/data/blacklist.json

* backend/data/*
    * come up with a more secure way to perform CRUD operations on these files that makes sure there are  always multiple updated instances available
    * keeping these here as raw JSON, exposed on the server, is not a good idea for testing or prod
    * need to find a way to automatically update these files very often, including the json pointing to external sources

* server.js - ipBlacklist usage causes "cannot load range_check* error

* register.html
    * confirm email as well

* dashboard.html
    * let users delete their accounts
    * export account data
    * general settings
        * ?

* user dashboard
    * security panel
    * settings paenl

* resources.html
    * recommend good password generators and a PW manager(?)


* 3rd party scripts
    * check against the expected hashes of the JS files
